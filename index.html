<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I have a degree in Computer Science from one of New Jersey's universities, but I work in something I like better, which is retail.</p>
<p>Here are some of the retail stores I have worked at and the amount of time I've spent working for them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CVS (2 years)</li>
  <li>Walgreens (1 year)</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined, I have more than 3 years of experience. During this time, I have held different positions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cashier (just for a few months)</li>
  <li>Shift Supervisor (I worked at CVS for a few years in this position, then moved to Walgreens where I started as a Shift Supervisor. Quickly, within months, I was promoted to Emerging Store Manager.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Computer Science</h3>
<p>Why did I choose Computer Science? Because I like challenges and how comfortable the job is. Plus, it was the only career that caught my eye. I like the diversity and the different things that can be done with a Computer Science degree.</p>
<p>I have taken different kinds of classes ranging from English, Math, Computer Science, Programming, Cybersecurity, and much more.</p>
<p>Do I have experience in this field? Yes, I do. Four years in college have taught me a lot of things, including management, programming, and much more. Plus, Iâ€™m very self-taught; I can learn things fast and adapt to different environments. I had never used HTML, and here I am, building a website using videos and help from AI.</p>
